# Launch LP's

The starter theme includes a pre-built template to get pages up as quickly as possible so there are endpoints to drive traffic to and start getting leads.

_Before creating and editing Launch LPs, make sure that the theme has been set up properly, including importing Advanced Custom Fields data._

## Editing Launch LPs

* The hero image should be at least 1920x960
* All content and styling choices for the page are located on the main edit page. For settings shared between all Launch LPs, go to the Theme Settings page. These include:
  * School logo
  * School contact information
  * Primary and secondary branding colors
  * Fonts
* Make sure the text in the Hero, Values, and About sections has enough contrast with the selected color. If needed, switch the text to a light or dark version as needed.
